# Weather-Monitoring-System

This project presents the development of an environment monitoring system which is used to monitor various parameters in the environment surrounding us. Its execution is based on the wireless sensor network, which consists of sensor nodes. A sensor node here comprises of a Node MCU with an on-chip wi-fi module and connected sensors. A wi-fi interface is deployed to exchange the environmental information from sensor nodes to a web-based platform, thereby employing the implementation of IOT. This helps in a graphical representation of the recorded
data. With the entire world talking about abrupt climatic changes in recent times, this system can play a vital role in determining the continuous variation in various environmental parameters. These variations in the data sensed by the sensors are stored in the form of an excel sheet. The data recorded can be used to observe and deduce conclusions about the possible calamitous situations resulting from climate related issues. It also enables the innovation of possible solutions to improve the environmental factors for better sustenance.
